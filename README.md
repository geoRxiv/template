# geoRxiv -- Forked from Distill

![geoRxiv logo](geoRxiv_logo.png)

The aim of this work is to provide a modern and intuitive way of doing scientific publications in Geosciences[1]. I'm a big of LaTeX, and the classical way of doing research. However, if things can be improved why not trying? We found that distill to be the best template to use: It is very easy, it also generate high quality publications. The killing feature of distill is the interactivity, something that you cannot find in the pdf documents. 

## Goal of this project
- We would like to create a unique publication experience for both authors and readers.
- Reproduciblity. We insist that the data used in the manuscript should be _easily_ accessible and linked in the submission. For now, we are considering using accompanying notebook to include the dataset, figure generations, algorithms used, etc.
- Interactivity. One of the main advantages of using HTML as oppose of pdf is the interactivity. You do _all_ kinda of crazy things. We will excessively use D3js in our figures.
- Submission made easy. The cycle of submitting is a work is quite easier. You only need to create a GitHub repo using our [template](https://distill.pub/guide), and submit it either to Ahmed Abdalla, or Mohamed Yousif (in the very near future we will add more editors as we go).

## What to expect from us
We are a local journal with international journals standards. Our goal as journal editors is to advance science by publishing high quality contents. Bottom line is, we cannot help if you do not intend to help yourself.
